## GPT4API - Node.js implementation

This project is a boilerplate for an API server that exposes various endpoints for specific use cases of interaction with the OpenAI GPT-4 API.

It is built from a POC and hopefully will grow into a mature solution with a proper architecture that would allow it to be used as a starting point for projects that would like to have their own API endpoints for front end client consumption.

### How this version has been built

A full disclosure of the basic API development process for the [First working GPT4 node.js API solution](https://tailorvj.github.io/gpt4api/blog/first-working-solution) can be found on the blog.
